      <description>The prefered method of preparing the salsa is using a blender.
Start by chopping up all the ingredients and placing them in the blender. Be cautious with how much salt you use. It is always safer to add a little then taste then add more.
Blend the salsa in pulses and occationally use a spatula to mix up any ingredients that have not been blended.
Pour and enjoy!</description>
