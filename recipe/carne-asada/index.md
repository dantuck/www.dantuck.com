Marinate the steak: Whisk to combine the olive oil, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, black pepper, and cumin in a large, non-reactive bowl or baking dish. Stir in the minced garlic, jalapeño, and cilantro.

Place the steak in a gallon size bag and then pour marinade over the steak. Give the bag a few shakes and message in the marinade for a moment. Refrigerate for 1-4 hours (if using flank steak marinate at least 3 hours).

Grill 6-8 minutes on each side depending on the thickness of the steak and preferred temperature.

Bonus: Do not discard the marinade but instead pour the marinade from the bag into a quart sauce pan and boil/simmer until reduced slightly. Spoon a generous portion on each serving of plated carne asada for an added AMAZING flavor.
