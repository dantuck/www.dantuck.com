1. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups buttermilk, kosher salt, and Tabasco unti the salt is dissolved. Add chicken pieces. Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. In a large pie plate or dish, whisk the following together:

  * brown rice flour
  * sweet rice flour
  * cornstarch
  * seasoning salt
  * baking powder
  * black pepper

Add remaining buttermilk and rub together until flower mixture is damp. If flour seems dry, add an additional tablespoon of buttermilk.

3. Dredge chicken in flour mixture, coating all sides with flour. Shake excess flour off each piece of chicken. Place coated chicken on a platter or wire rack. Heat &frac34; to 1 inch of oil in a 12 inch cast iron skillet to 375&#176;F. Working in batches, fry chicken. Don't crowd the pan. Cook chicken until golden brown and crip and internal temperature registers 165&#176;F on an instant read thermometer, about two minutes per side.

4. Transfer chicken to plate lined with paper towels. Season with salt. Serve immediately.
