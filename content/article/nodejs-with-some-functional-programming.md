## Hello!

This is the first post in a series focused on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/ "NodeJS"). Node is a asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications. Just like JavaScript, NodeJS is not actually a functional programming language but is a good place to use functional programming if you so please.

## So what is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming pattern. Generally it can be used in many different language but some are specifically geared toward it such as Haskell and Lisp. It's not that you can't do it in other languages but instead it is just a design decision in most cases.

For the purpose of this article I am focusing on some of the basics of functional programming. Functional programming does the following at it's core:

* Treats computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
* Avoids changing state and mutable data.
